How to contribute to Eclipse Unide Python
=========================================

First of all, thanks for considering to contribute to the testbed. We really
appreciate the time and effort you want to spend helping to improve things
around here. And help we can use :-)

Here is a (non-exclusive, non-prioritized) list of things you might be able to
help us with:

* bug reports
* bug fixes
* improvements regarding code quality e.g. improving readability, performance,
  modularity etc.
* documentation (Getting Started guide, Examples, â€¦)
* features (both ideas and code are welcome)
* tests

In order to get you started as fast as possible we need to go through some
organizational issues first.

Legal Requirements
------------------

Unide Python is an `Eclipse IoT <http://iot.eclipse.org>`_ project and as such
is governed by the Eclipse Development process.  This process helps us in
creating great open source software within a safe legal framework.

First Steps
'''''''''''

For you as a contributor, the following preliminary steps are required in order
for us to be able to accept your contribution:

* Sign the `Eclipse Foundation Contributor License Agreement
  <http://www.eclipse.org/legal/CLA.php>`_.  In order to do so:

  * Obtain an Eclipse Foundation user ID. Anyone who currently uses Eclipse
    Bugzilla or Gerrit systems already has one of those.  If you don't already
    have an account simply `register on the Eclipse web site
    <https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/createaccount.php>`_

  * Once you have your account, log in to the `projects portal
    <https://projects.eclipse.org/>`_, select *My Account* and then the
    *Contributor License Agreement* tab.

* Add your GitHub username to your Eclipse Foundation account. Log in to
  Eclipse and go to `Edit my account
  <https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php>`_.

How to Contribute
'''''''''''''''''

The easiest way to contribute code/patches/whatever is by creating a GitHub
pull request (PR). When you do make sure that you *Sign-off* your commit
records using the same email address used for your Eclipse account.

You do this by adding the ``-s`` flag when you make the commit(s), e.g.::

  $> git commit -s -m "Shave the yak some more"

You can find all the details in the `Contributing via Git
<http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git>`_ document
on the Eclipse web site.


Preparing the environment
-------------------------

You will need to install `make
<https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html>`_ and `pyenv
<https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ as well.


* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Clone the repository locally and ``cd`` into it
* Run ``make all`` to generate a local Python virtual environment and ensure the
  test suite runs properly (this may take some minutes the first time)

Making your Changes
-------------------

* Create a new branch for your changes
* Make your changes
* Make sure you include test cases for non-trivial features
* Make sure the test suite passes after your changes. Run ``make tests``
* Make sure copyright headers are included in (all) files including updated year(s)
* Make sure build plugins and dependencies and their versions have (approved) CQs
* Make sure proper headers are in place for each file (see above Legal Requirements)
* Commit your changes into that branch
* Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages
* If you have a lot of commits squash them into a single commit
* Make sure you use the `-s` flag when committing as explained above
* Push your changes to your branch in your forked repository

Submitting the Changes
----------------------

Submit a pull request via the normal GitHub UI.

After Submitting
----------------

* Do not use your branch for any other development, otherwise further changes
  that you make will be visible in the PR.
